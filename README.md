# sourceknight

A simple dependency manager and build system for sourcemod projects

## Overview

The goal is to let a config file specify how to grab and unpack dependencies into a temporary build directory. Then, they won't clutter up your source tree and it'll be easier to rebuild your project.

## Status

If you're somehow stumbling across this repo already, I'm terribly sorry because it doesn't do anything yet. I've drafted a spec for project specifications and that's about it.
